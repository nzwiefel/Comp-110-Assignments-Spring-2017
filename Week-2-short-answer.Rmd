a) Taffy: value of var for specific case

b) Year: quantitative (?)

c) sex: categorical

d) name: categorical

e) count: quantitative

1.2:

The var "number of states" has mostly quantitative values - however, it also has a case with the value "it depends". Additionally, for the var "in office", the majority of cases have the format YYYY-YYYY, whereas one case has the value YYYY to YYYY thus breaking the format. If one wanted to get really picky, they could suggest that the "in office" variable be split up into two vars - "entered office" and "left office". Finally, the "president" variable has inconsistant formatting: the first case has Last, First format, whereas the other two have a First Last format.
